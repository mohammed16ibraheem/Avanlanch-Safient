Role of AI in SafientAI

The AI isn’t just a buzzword — it has a real role:

1. Transaction Risk Scoring

AI analyzes each transaction before it’s finalized.

Looks at things like: suspicious wallet addresses, unusual transaction size, new/unknown dApps, known scam contracts.

Assigns a risk level (safe, warning, high risk).



2. User Behavior Monitoring

Learns normal user patterns (e.g., typical amounts, frequency, usual recipient wallets).

Flags abnormal activity (suddenly sending funds to a new risky address at 2 AM).



3. Fraud & Phishing Detection

Detects if the site or dApp user connected to is a clone or malicious contract.

Warns user before confirming.



4. Management Assistant

Suggests whether to auto-release, delay, or cancel a transaction.

Example: If AI detects high fraud risk, it can recommend auto-hold in  until user confirms again.

Why It’s Powerful

Traditional wallets = one click → irreversible loss.

SafientAI = AI + buffer → user control, fraud protection, fund recovery.

It’s like “Undo Button for Crypto Transactions” powered by AI.

So in simple terms:

 smart contract = safety net

AI = intelligent guardian that decides when to block, warn, or allow a transaction
